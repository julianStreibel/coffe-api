## Coffee Api

This api is serving my coffee machine app [coffe](https://github.com/julianStreibel/coffe).
You can set the machine to turn on at a specific time and set an automated stop so it isnÂ´t heating the hole day. You can also see the status of the machine.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for demo purposes.

```
npm install
node index.js
```
